# Real-Time Workflow Monitor

![alt text](https://github.com/acoyfellow/workflow-live/blob/main/src/static/sketch.svg?raw=true)

Simple pattern for real-time workflow monitoring using Cloudflare Workers, Workflows, and Durable Objects.

## Why?
This project started as a challenge to build a real-time interface for Cloudflare Workers. The pattern enables powerful architectures for:
- AI Agent monitoring and control
- Edge computing mini-apps
- Real-time workflow orchestration
- Live system monitoring
- Interactive edge applications

## Demo
Try it live at [workflow-live.coey.dev](https://workflow-live.coey.dev/)

## Features
- WebSocket-based live updates from workflows
- Durable Object for connection management
- Minimal frontend for workflow control and monitoring
- Real-time workflow status updates
- Automatic error handling and retries
- Clean, accessible UI

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to build real-time workflow monitoring using Cloudflare's edge technologies. It uses WebSockets to stream live updates from Cloudflare Workflows to connected clients, with Durable Objects managing the WebSocket connections.

The demo includes a simple workflow that:
1. Executes a series of steps
2. Broadcasts progress updates in real-time
3. Handles failures gracefully
4. Provides visual feedback through the UI

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Bun 1.2.2 / Node.js 16+
- Cloudflare Workers account
- Wrangler CLI

### Installation

```
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/acoyfellow/workflow-live
cd workflow-live

# Install dependencies 
bun install

# Configure Cloudflare
wrangler login

# Deploy
bun run deploy
```

### Development

```
bun run dev
```

## Architecture

The project consists of three main components:

1. **Worker (src/index.ts)**
   - Handles HTTP/WebSocket routing
   - Manages workflow execution
   - Broadcasts updates via Durable Object

2. **Durable Object**
   - Manages WebSocket connections
   - Handles broadcast messaging
   - Maintains connection state

3. **Frontend (src/static/index.html)**
   - Simple, accessible UI
   - Real-time status updates
   - Error handling and retries
